## Project Description 
___
###  Built with Youtube tutorial by **_smollJames (video link at the bottom)_**.
> This project is a web application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS frameworks with youtube tutorials by
>  The primary goal of this application is to transcribe and translate .mp3 audio files into text using machine learning models. Additionally, users can record custom audio using the browser's MediaRecorder API and provide it as input for transcription.
> 
> Key Features:
> 1. Audio Input: Users can upload .mp3 audio files or record custom audio using the browser.
> 2. Transcription: The application transcribes the audio input into text using machine learning models provided by the xenova/transformers library.
> 3. Translation: Users can translate the transcribed text into multiple languages using the same machine learning models.
> 4. Real-time Processing: The heavy backend computations are offloaded to a separate worker object of the Worker class in JavaScript, ensuring smooth performance of the UI.
> 5. Integration of ML Models: The application integrates the hugging face pretrained models via the xenova/transformers library, which includes transformers.js running on an ONNX runtime environment. This allows for efficient execution of machine learning tasks directly in the browser.
> 6. Pipeline Processing: Transcription and translation tasks are performed using a pipeline approach, ensuring efficient and accurate processing of audio data.
> 7. Responsive UI: The user interface is fully completed and designed using Tailwind CSS, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
> Overall, the "Audio Transcription and Translation Tool" aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient solution for transcribing and translating audio content using advanced machine learning techniques directly in the browser.
 ### Despite the transcription and translation functionalities are not functionally operational due to ML related model conflicts, the UI portion of the application is fully implemented and offers a user-friendly experience.
